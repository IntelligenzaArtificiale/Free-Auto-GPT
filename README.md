By the way, thank you so much for [![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/IntelligenzaArtificiale/Free-AUTOGPT-with-NO-API?style=social)](https://github.com/IntelligenzaArtificiale/Free-AUTOGPT-with-NO-API/stargazers) and all the support!!

## WHY THIS REPOSITORY? 🤔

Hello everyone,

I wanted to start by **talking about how important it is to democratize AI**. Unfortunately, most new applications or discoveries in this field end up enriching some big companies, leaving behind small businesses or simple projects. One striking example of this is Autogpt, an autonomous AI agent capable of performing tasks.

Autogpt and similar projects like BabyAGI **only work with paid APIs, which is not fair**. That's why I tried to recreate a simpler but very interesting and, above all, open-source version of Autogpt that **does not require any API and does not need any particular hardware.**

I believe that by providing free and open-source AI tools, we can give small businesses and individuals the opportunity to create new and innovative projects without the need for significant financial investment. **This will allow for more equitable and diverse access to AI technology, which is essential for advancing society as a whole.**

## HOW IT WORKS ? 🔨🔩

  </summary>


To create an open-source version of Autogpt that does not require paid APIs or specific hardware, **we performed a reverse engineering process on ChatGPT**, a language model developed by OpenAI. By doing so, we were able to use the agents and new technologies of langchain for free.

We then created a custom LLM wrapper with langchain, **which can be used as a plug-and-play solution with any langchain function or tool 💡**.

```python
from FreeLLM import ChatGPTAPI 

# Instantiate a ChatGPT object with your token
llm = ChatGPTAPI.ChatGPT((token="YOURTOKEN")  #for start new chat

# If you have a Plus subscription , you can use GPT4 model
 llm = ChatGPTAPI.ChatGPT((token="YOURTOKEN", model="gpt4") # REQUIRED CHATGPT PLUS subscription

# or if if u would to start from an existing chat 
# llm = ChatGPTAPI.ChatGPT(token = "YOUR-TOKEN", conversation = "Add-XXXX-XXXX-Convesation-ID")


# Generate a response based on the given prompt
response = llm("Hello, how are you?")

# Print the response
print(response)

```
![exixstingchat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108482353/235359284-c908afe6-1f18-41ff-aa30-8216a1b9f19a.png)


The code snippet provided above shows how to use our custom ChatGPT LLM class to interact with the language model. It requires a token from the ChatGPT API, which can be obtained from [https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session](https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session). 

Please note that there is a limit of 50 requests per hour for each account on the ChatGPT API 💣. Therefore, we implemented a call counter in our ChatGPT class to prevent exceeding this limit.


### Now support HuggingCHAT LLM 

```python
from FreeLLM import HuggingChatAPI 

# Instantiate a ChatGPT object with your token
llm = HuggingChatAPI.HuggingChat()  #for start new chat

# Generate a response based on the given prompt
response = llm("Hello, how are you?")

# Print the response
print(response)

```

### Now support Bing CHAT LLM 

```python
from FreeLLM import BingChatAPI 

# Instantiate a Bing CHAT object with your cookie path
llm=BingChatAPI.BingChat(cookiepath="cookie_path")  #for start new chat

# if you want set the type of conversation style
#llm=BingChatAPI.BingChat(cookiepath=cookie_path, conversation_style="creative") #conversation_style must be precise, creative or balanced

# if you want set Microsoft Bing internet Access
#llm = =BingChatAPI.BingChat(cookiepath = "YOUR-COOKIE" , conversation_style = "precise" , search_result=True) #with web access


# Generate a response based on the given prompt
response = llm("Hello, how are you?")

# Print the response
print(response)

```

### Now support Google BARD CHAT LLM 

```python
from FreeLLM import BardChatAPI 

# Instantiate a Bard CHAT object with your cookie path
llm=BardChatAPI.BardChat(cookie="cookie") #for start new chat

# Generate a response based on the given prompt
response = llm("Hello, how are you?")

# Print the response
print(response)

```

We believe that our open-source version of Autogpt will promote equitable and diverse access to AI technology and empower individuals and small businesses to create innovative AI projects without significant financial investment.

**This is an example of CUSTOM agent, in less of 60 line of code and totally for free, with:**
- **Internet** access
- Python **code execution**
- **Wikipedia** knowledge

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent #use for create new agent
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain.tools import BaseTool, DuckDuckGoSearchRun
from langchain.utilities import PythonREPL #tool for execute python script
from langchain.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper #tool get wiki info
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchTool #tool get interet live info (langchain==0.0.150)

from FreeLLM import ChatGPTAPI # FREE CHATGPT API
#or
from FreeLLM import HuggingChatAPI 
from FreeLLM import BingChatAPI 
from FreeLLM import BardChatAPI 


# Instantiate a ChatGPT object with your token
llm = ChatGPTAPI.ChatGPT((token="YOURTOKEN")

# or use Bing CHAT
# llm = BingChatAPI.BingChat(cookiepath="cookie_path")

# or use Google BArd CHAT
# llm=BardChatAPI.BardChat(cookie="cookie") 

# or use HuggingChatAPI if u don't have CHATGPT, BING or Google account
# llm = HuggingChatAPI.HuggingChat() 


# Define the tools
wikipedia = WikipediaAPIWrapper()
python_repl = PythonREPL()
search = DuckDuckGoSearchTool()

tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "python repl",
        func=python_repl.run,
        description="useful for when you need to use python to answer a question. You should input python code"
    )
]

wikipedia_tool = Tool(
    name='wikipedia',
    func= wikipedia.run,
    description="Useful for when you need to look up a topic, country or person on wikipedia"
)

duckduckgo_tool = Tool(
    name='DuckDuckGo Search',
    func= search.run,
    description="Useful for when you need to do a search on the internet to find information that another tool can't find. be specific with your input."
)

tools.append(duckduckgo_tool)
tools.append(wikipedia_tool)


#Create the Agent
iteration = (int(input("Enter the number of iterations: ")) if input("Do you want to set the number of iterations? (y/n): ") == "y" else 3)

zero_shot_agent = initialize_agent(
    agent="zero-shot-react-description", 
    tools=tools, 
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True,
    max_iterations=iteration,
)

# Start your Custom Agent in loop
print(">> STRAT CUSTOM AGENT")
print("> Digit 'exit' for exit or 'your task or question' for start\n\n")
prompt = input("(Enter your task or question) >> ")
while prompt.toLowerCase() != "exit":
    zero_shot_agent.run(prompt)
    prompt = input("(Enter your task or question) >> ")
    
# SO ESASY :)

```
